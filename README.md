# Basic operation on these two numbers
a = int(input("Enter a first number: "))
This line prompts the user to enter the first number. The input() function captures the user's input as a string, and int() converts it to an integer, which is then stored in the variable a.
b = int(input("Enter a second number: "))
Similar to the previous line, this line prompts the user to enter the second number. The input is converted to an integer and stored in the variable b.
c = a + b
This line calculates the sum of the two numbers stored in a and b, and assigns the result to the variable c.
print("Addition :", c)
This line prints the result of the addition operation, displaying the message "Addition :" followed by the value of c.
c = a - b
Here, the code calculates the difference between a and b (subtracting b from a) and assigns the result to c.
print("Subtraction :", c)
This line prints the result of the subtraction operation, displaying "Subtraction :" followed by the value of c.
c = a * b
This line calculates the product of a and b (multiplying them) and assigns the result to c.
print("Multiplication :", c)
This line prints the result of the multiplication operation, displaying "Multiplication :" followed by the value of c.
c = a / b
Here, the code calculates the division of a by b and assigns the result to c.
print("Division :", c)
This line prints the result of the division operation, displaying "Division :" followed by the value of c.
